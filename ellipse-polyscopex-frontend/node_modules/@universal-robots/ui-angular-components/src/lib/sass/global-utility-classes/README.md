**Global Utility Classes**

This directory should include classes generations to be used in the HTML
that will allow people to style things without touching CSS

***None of these files should be included/imported in other files except for globals.scss***

They are meant to be imported once and be available everywhere.

For things meant to be imported in other .scss files check the "utils" directory
