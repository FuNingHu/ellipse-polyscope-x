# ContributionApi

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project contribution-api` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project contribution-api`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project contribution-api` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build contribution-api` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build contribution-api`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/contribution-api` and run `npm publish`.

## Using npm link For Development and Builds

You can use `npm link` to add local changes from projects managed via npm.
